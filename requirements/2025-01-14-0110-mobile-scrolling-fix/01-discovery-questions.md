# Discovery Questions

These questions will help us understand the scope and context of the scrolling issues on mobile web.

## Q1: Are these scrolling issues occurring only on touch-enabled devices (phones/tablets) or also when using a mouse on desktop browsers in mobile view?
**Default if unknown:** Yes, only on touch-enabled devices (most mobile web scrolling issues are touch-specific)

## Q2: Did these scrolling issues start appearing after a recent update or have they always been present since the mobile web version was deployed?
**Default if unknown:** No, they've always been present (suggesting it's a platform compatibility issue rather than a regression)

## Q3: Are you experiencing similar scrolling issues on any other pages in the app besides properties, tenants, and maintenance?
**Default if unknown:** No (the issue seems isolated to these specific pages with card-based layouts)

## Q4: Do you need the stats section on the maintenance page to remain visible at all times (sticky header behavior) or should it scroll away with the page content?
**Default if unknown:** No, it should scroll with the content (matching the behavior on other pages)

## Q5: Are users reporting this issue across different mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) or is it specific to one browser?
**Default if unknown:** Yes, across all browsers (React Native Web issues typically affect all browsers similarly)
