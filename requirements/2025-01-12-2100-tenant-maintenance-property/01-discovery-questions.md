## Q1: Do all tenants need to have an active rental contract before they can create maintenance requests?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (tenants should only request maintenance for properties they are actively renting)

## Q2: Should the system show a helpful message when a tenant has no active contracts instead of showing an empty property list?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better user experience to explain why no properties are available)

## Q3: Should the property selection be required for all maintenance requests?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintenance requests must be associated with a specific property)

## Q4: Should tenants only see properties from their active contracts (not expired or cancelled ones)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (expired contracts shouldn't allow new maintenance requests)

## Q5: Should the system automatically pre-select the property if a tenant only has one active rental?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (reduces clicks and improves user experience for single-property tenants)
