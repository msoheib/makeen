# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-12 21:00

## User Request
the maintenance page for the tenants user roles does not show the property they have been assigned to on the maintenance page to select for maintenance requests

## Problem Description
Tenants who are assigned to properties cannot see their assigned property in the maintenance page when trying to create a maintenance request. This prevents tenants from selecting the property they're renting, making it impossible for them to submit maintenance requests.

## Expected Outcome
- Tenants should see their assigned/rented property in the property selection dropdown on the maintenance request page
- Tenants should only see properties they are currently renting (not all properties)
- Tenants should be able to select their property and submit maintenance requests

## Context
This is a critical functionality issue that affects the core workflow for tenant users in the property management system. Without this functionality, tenants cannot report maintenance issues, which is a fundamental feature of the application.
