# Expert Detail Questions

## Q1: Should we add comprehensive logging to help debug the property data extraction and identify the exact response structure?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (debugging data mapping issues requires visibility into the actual data structure)

## Q2: Should the property be automatically pre-selected and the selection UI hidden when a tenant has only one active contract?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (since tenants in this app only have one property assigned, streamline the UX)

## Q3: Should we add proper error handling to distinguish between "no contracts" vs "contracts exist but property data missing"?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better error messages help users and developers understand what went wrong)

## Q4: Should we add TypeScript interfaces for the contract-with-property response to prevent similar data mapping issues?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (type safety prevents runtime errors and improves code maintainability)

## Q5: Should we validate that the property data exists before attempting to display it in the selection modal?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (defensive programming prevents crashes when data is incomplete or malformed)
