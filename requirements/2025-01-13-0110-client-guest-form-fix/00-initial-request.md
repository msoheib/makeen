# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-01-13 01:10
**Requestor:** User
**Feature:** Client and Guest User Form Fix

## Original Request

i am visiting the site http://localhost:3000/testing/client and no i dont not see the changes to the form. can you please fix this for the clients and guest user roles

## Problem Summary

The user is accessing a testing/client route at localhost:3000/testing/client and reports that form changes are not visible for client and guest user roles. This suggests there may be:

1. Role-based conditional rendering issues
2. Missing form implementations for client/guest roles
3. Routing or access control problems
4. Form component not reflecting recent changes for these specific user types

## Context

This appears to be related to the recent property access control system implementation, where different user roles (tenant, owner, manager, admin) have different form visibility and functionality. The client and guest roles may have been overlooked in the recent updates.

## Expected Outcome

Client and guest user roles should be able to see and interact with appropriate form elements at the testing/client route, with proper role-based access control and functionality.
