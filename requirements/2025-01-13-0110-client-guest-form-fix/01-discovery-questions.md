# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Do you need a dedicated "testing/client" route for testing client functionality?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (testing routes are commonly needed for development and QA purposes)

## Q2: Should "client" and "guest" be separate user roles from the existing "buyer" role?
**Default if unknown:** No (buyer role likely serves the same purpose as client, and guest is typically unauthenticated)

## Q3: Should client/buyer users be able to see all the same form features as property managers and owners?
**Default if unknown:** No (client/buyer roles typically have more limited access compared to property management roles)

## Q4: Do you want guest (unauthenticated) users to have access to property forms at all?
**Default if unknown:** No (forms typically require authentication for security and data integrity)

## Q5: Should the recent property access control changes apply the same restrictions to buyer/client roles as other user types?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent security model across all user roles is important)
