# Expert Detail Questions

## Q1: Should we disable the demo admin fallback in lib/security.ts and properly handle authentication failures instead?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (demo fallbacks hide real authentication issues and security vulnerabilities)

## Q2: Should required login fields (first_name, last_name, email) always display actual values while optional fields (phone, address) can show empty when null?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on user requirement: "some data that are required for login so put them there")

## Q3: Should we add comprehensive logging to trace the exact point where authentication â†’ profile data flow breaks?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (debugging authentication issues requires detailed logging to identify failure points)

## Q4: Should we implement user data isolation testing with multiple accounts to ensure users only see their own profile information?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (user emphasized: "yes absolutely - it is very important to have isolation")

## Q5: Should we unify the profile data structure between the store (firstName/lastName) and database (first_name/last_name) schemas?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (data structure mismatches cause synchronization issues and display problems)
