## Q6: Should we completely remove the height constraint (height: 26) from the statusChip style in MaintenanceRequestCard.tsx?
**Answer:** Yes (default - user indicated "idk")

## Q7: Should we maintain the current visual density by replacing the fixed height with paddingVertical similar to StatusBadge component?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q8: Do you want to apply this same fix to any other Chip components in the codebase that might have similar height constraints?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q9: Should we preserve the current font weight ('500') and color scheme while fixing the clipping issue?
**Answer:** Yes (default - user indicated "idk")

## Q10: Do you want to add explicit minHeight instead of fixed height to ensure chips don't become too small on different screen densities?
**Answer:** Yes

## Implementation Summary
- Remove fixed height constraint from MaintenanceRequestCard
- Replace with paddingVertical for consistent spacing
- Apply similar fixes across other Chip components
- Preserve existing visual styling (colors, fonts)
- Add minHeight for density scaling protection
