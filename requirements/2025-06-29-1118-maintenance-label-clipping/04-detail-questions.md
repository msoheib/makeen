# Expert Detail Questions

Technical questions based on deep codebase analysis to clarify implementation requirements.

## Q6: Should we completely remove the height constraint (height: 26) from the statusChip style in MaintenanceRequestCard.tsx?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (following the pattern of StatusBadge and other working chip components that auto-size)

## Q7: Should we maintain the current visual density by replacing the fixed height with paddingVertical similar to StatusBadge component?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (StatusBadge uses paddingVertical: 4 which provides consistent spacing without clipping)

## Q8: Do you want to apply this same fix to any other Chip components in the codebase that might have similar height constraints?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures consistency across all status chips and prevents similar issues)

## Q9: Should we preserve the current font weight ('500') and color scheme while fixing the clipping issue?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains visual consistency with existing design system)

## Q10: Do you want to add explicit minHeight instead of fixed height to ensure chips don't become too small on different screen densities?
**Default if unknown:** No (React Native Paper Chip should handle density scaling automatically)
