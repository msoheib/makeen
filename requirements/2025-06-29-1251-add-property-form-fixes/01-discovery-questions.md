# Discovery Questions

These questions help understand the specific requirements for the add property form improvements.

## Q1: Should the payment method change be applied to existing properties in the database, or only affect new property additions?
**Default if unknown:** No (changes should only affect the form behavior, not existing data)

## Q2: When replacing "country" with "district", should we preserve the existing validation requirements (required field)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (district should remain a required field like country was)

## Q3: Should the property type clipping issue be fixed by adjusting the SegmentedButtons component styling or container layout?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (SegmentedButtons component likely needs styling adjustments for proper text display)

## Q4: Do you want to update the Arabic translations file to reflect the new field names (street, district) for consistency across the app?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (translations should be updated to maintain consistency)

## Q5: Should the form data structure and database schema remain the same internally, just changing the UI labels and options?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (preserve backend compatibility while only updating the user interface)
