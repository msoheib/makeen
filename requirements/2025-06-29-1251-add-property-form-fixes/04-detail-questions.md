# Expert Detail Questions

Technical questions to clarify the specific implementation approach for the add property form improvements.

## Q6: Should we create a database migration to rename the existing "country" and "neighborhood" columns to "district" and "street" respectively?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains data integrity and updates schema properly)

## Q7: Do you want to update the PaymentMethod type definition to only include 'cash' and remove 'installment' from the entire application?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures consistency across the application and prevents installment option from appearing elsewhere)

## Q8: Should we add minHeight and proper padding to the SegmentedButtons style to fix the property type text clipping issue?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (SegmentedButtons likely need height and padding adjustments for proper text display)

## Q9: Do you want to set "المملكة العربية السعودية" (Saudi Arabia) as a default value for the district field since all properties are in Saudi Arabia?
**Default if unknown:** No (district should be a user-input field for specific districts within Saudi Arabia)

## Q10: Should we update all property display components (PropertyCard, property listings) to show the new "street" and "district" fields instead of the old location structure?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures consistency across the entire application interface)
