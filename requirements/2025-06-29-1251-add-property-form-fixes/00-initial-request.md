**User Request:** Fix multiple issues in the add property form

## Original Request
The user has identified several issues with the add property form that need to be fixed:

1. **Payment Method**: Should only have "cash" by default - remove the installment option
2. **Field Restructuring**: 
   - Replace "district" field with "street" (in Arabic)
   - Replace "country" field with "district" (since all properties are in Saudi Arabia)
   - Ensure all labels are in Arabic
3. **Visual Issue**: Property type options are being incompletely clipped on the form

## Context
These are localization and business logic improvements for the Saudi Arabian real estate market, plus a UI clipping fix for better user experience.
