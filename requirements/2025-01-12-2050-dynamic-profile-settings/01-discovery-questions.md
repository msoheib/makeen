# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should we add the missing translation keys to both English and Arabic translation files?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the app supports both languages and consistency is required)

## Q2: Should the translation keys follow the existing naming convention in the settings.json file?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintain consistency with existing translation structure)

## Q3: Should we test the profile display on both the Profile page and Settings page after fixing the translations?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (both pages may use similar profile data display patterns)

## Q4: Should we verify that the data fetching from Supabase is working correctly before applying the translation fix?
**Default if unknown:** No (analysis shows data fetching is already working correctly, this is purely a translation issue)

## Q5: Should we also check for similar missing translation keys in other parts of the app?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevent similar issues in other components using profile data)
