# Code Analysis

**Date:** 2025-01-12 20:50
**Status:** Complete

## Hardcoded Data Identified

### Settings Page (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`)
- **Line 236:** `description="admin@realestate.com"` - Hardcoded email in profile section
- **Issue:** Profile display shows static admin email instead of current user's email
- **Impact:** All users see the same admin email regardless of who is logged in

### Profile Page (`app/profile/index.tsx`)
- **Line 119:** `{editedProfile.email || 'user@example.com'}` - Fallback to example email
- **Lines 16-24:** Profile data sourced from store's `userProfile` with empty defaults
- **Lines 32-38:** Updates only go to store, not database
- **Issue:** No database integration for fetching or persisting user data

## Current Data Flow

### Store Integration
- Both pages use `useAppStore` for user profile data
- Store has `settings.userProfile` object with properties:
  - name, email, phone, company, address, city, country
- Profile page updates store via `updateSettings()` but doesn't persist to database

### Missing Database Integration
- No queries to fetch current user's actual data from database
- No mutations to save profile changes to database
- Store data appears to be initialized with empty/default values

## Technical Context

### Available Infrastructure
- Supabase client configured in `lib/supabase.ts`
- User authentication system in place
- Store management with Zustand in `lib/store.ts`

### Data Requirements
- Need to identify which database table contains user profile information
- Need to fetch user data based on authenticated user ID
- Need to implement save functionality to persist changes
