# Discovery Questions

These questions help understand the scope and impact of the UI regression after the maintenance card fix.

## Q1: Are you seeing a completely blank maintenance page, or is just the stats section and bottom navbar missing?
**Default if unknown:** No (assuming other content like header and list are still visible)

## Q2: Does the maintenance page still show the header (title "الصيانة") and search/filter sections?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (these are separate from stats section and should not be affected by card styling changes)

## Q3: Is the issue visible immediately when you navigate to the maintenance tab, or only after performing certain actions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (regression issues typically manifest immediately upon page load)

## Q4: Are other tabs in the bottom navigation also missing their UI components, or is this specific to the maintenance tab?
**Default if unknown:** No (issue is likely specific to maintenance page based on the description)

## Q5: Can you still see the floating action button (+ button) for adding new maintenance requests?
**Default if unknown:** No (FAB positioning might be affected if bottom navbar layout changed)
