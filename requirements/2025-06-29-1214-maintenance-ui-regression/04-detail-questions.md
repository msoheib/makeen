# Expert Detail Questions

Technical questions to clarify the specific fix approach for the performance regression.

## Q6: Should we move the StyleSheet.create() outside the MaintenanceRequestCard component function to fix the performance issue?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (this is a critical React Native performance violation causing the infinite loading)

## Q7: Do you want to preserve the dynamic theming capability while fixing the performance issue using useMemo for dynamic styles?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains current functionality while fixing performance)

## Q8: Should we add error boundaries around the MaintenanceRequestCard to prevent cascade failures affecting navigation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents component errors from breaking the entire page and navigation)

## Q9: Do you want to add input validation for API data (dates, image URLs) to prevent runtime errors in the card component?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (defensive programming to prevent crashes from malformed data)

## Q10: Should we verify the fix resolves both the missing stats section and bottom navigation issues before closing?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ensures the fix addresses the complete regression, not just partial symptoms)
