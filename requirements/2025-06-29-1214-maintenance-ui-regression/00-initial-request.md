# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-06-29 12:14
**User Request:** The stats card on the maintenance page is gone and the bottom navbar is also gone after the fix

## Original Request
After implementing the fix for the maintenance card label clipping issue, a regression has occurred where:
1. Stats cards are no longer visible on the maintenance page
2. Bottom navigation bar has disappeared

## Context
This is a critical UI regression that occurred following the previous maintenance card styling fix. Users can no longer see key statistics or navigate between tabs, severely impacting the app's usability.

## Urgency
High - This appears to be a breaking change that affects core navigation and data visibility.
