# Detail Questions

These are expert-level questions based on deep codebase analysis to clarify expected system behavior.

## Q6: Should we reuse the existing `HorizontalStatsShimmer` component for the maintenance stats section at lines 177-232?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the maintenance stats layout exactly matches the dashboard horizontal stats pattern)

## Q7: Should the new MaintenanceCardShimmer include an image placeholder to match the MaintenanceRequestCard's image thumbnail?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains visual consistency with the actual card structure)

## Q8: Should we show shimmer effects during pull-to-refresh or only during initial page load?
**Default if unknown:** No (pull-to-refresh should use existing RefreshControl indicator, shimmer for initial load only)

## Q9: Should the maintenance list shimmer show a fixed number of placeholder cards (e.g., 5 cards)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent with other pages showing 3-5 shimmer items for list content)

## Q10: Should we preserve the current loading condition `(loading && !requests) || userLoading` for showing shimmer effects?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains existing loading behavior while replacing ActivityIndicator with shimmer)
