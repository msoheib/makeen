## User Request
In the add property form there are a couple of issues:

1. "The payment method" should only have cash by default so can you remove the installment option
2. Can you replace the "district" field with "street" in Arabic and can you replace the country with "district" because all the properties will be only in one country i.e. Saudi Arabia. Please make sure that this is all in Arabic
3. Can you make sure the type of the property on the form are not being incompletely clipped
