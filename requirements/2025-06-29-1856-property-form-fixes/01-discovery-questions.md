# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Will the property form be used exclusively for properties in Saudi Arabia?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on the request mentioning "all properties will be only in one country i.e. Saudi Arabia")

## Q2: Should the payment method default to "cash" but still allow users to select other payment methods later if they appear in the system?
**Default if unknown:** No (request says "only have cash by default" and to "remove the installment option")

## Q3: Will the "street" field (replacing "district") be a required field like the current district field?
**Default if unknown:** No (street information is typically more detailed and optional)

## Q4: Should the property type buttons automatically resize their text to fit within the button boundaries?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better UX to ensure all text is visible)

## Q5: Will there be a need to support other countries in the future, or should we permanently remove the country field from the database?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep it in database but default to Saudi Arabia in the UI)
