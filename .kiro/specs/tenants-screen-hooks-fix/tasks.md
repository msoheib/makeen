# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Restructure hook calls for consistent ordering










  - Move all hook calls to the top of the TenantsScreen component before any conditional logic
  - Ensure hooks are always called in the same order regardless of component state
  - Implement early return pattern after all hooks are called
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_



- [ ] 2. Fix import and export issues
  - Verify all component imports are properly exported from their source modules
  - Check for undefined component references in JSX rendering
  - Validate all icon imports from lucide-react-native are correctly imported


  - Test that all imported components render without throwing undefined errors
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Optimize memoized components and callbacks
  - Fix ListHeaderComponent memoization to prevent hook order changes
  - Ensure stable dependency arrays for all useMemo and useCallback hooks
  - Remove or fix any conditional memoization that could cause hook violations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Implement proper conditional rendering structure
  - Use early return pattern for loading, access denied, and error states
  - Ensure all conditional renders happen after hook calls are complete
  - Maintain consistent component structure across all render paths
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Add error boundary protection and testing
  - Create unit tests to verify hook order consistency across renders
  - Test component rendering with different permission states
  - Validate that all imported components render correctly
  - Add tests for search functionality and state transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.4_
