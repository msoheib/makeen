# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TenantsScreen component is experiencing critical React Hooks violations that are causing the application to crash. The error indicates that hooks are being called in different orders between renders, and there's an undefined component being rendered. This needs to be fixed to ensure the tenants screen functions properly and follows React's Rules of Hooks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a manager or admin user, I want to access the tenants screen without encountering React errors, so that I can manage tenant information effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tenants screen is loaded THEN the component SHALL render without React Hooks violations
2. WHEN the component re-renders THEN hooks SHALL be called in the same order consistently
3. WHEN the component mounts THEN all imported components SHALL be properly defined and exported
4. WHEN the user navigates to the tenants screen THEN the application SHALL not crash or show error boundaries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TenantsScreen component to follow React best practices, so that the code is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the component code THEN all hooks SHALL be called at the top level of the component
2. WHEN hooks are used conditionally THEN they SHALL be properly structured to maintain consistent order
3. WHEN components are imported THEN they SHALL have proper default or named exports
4. WHEN the component renders THEN all JSX elements SHALL reference valid React components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with manager or admin role, I want the tenants functionality to work correctly, so that I can perform my property management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the tenants screen THEN the user context SHALL be properly validated
2. WHEN the component loads THEN tenant data SHALL be fetched and displayed correctly
3. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the screen access SHALL work without causing hook violations
4. WHEN the component updates THEN state management SHALL not interfere with hook ordering
