## Requirements

1. **Main Screen Layout**
   - Header with title "Maintenance Requests" and filter/search options
   - List view displaying all maintenance requests from database
   - Floating Action Button (FAB) to add new maintenance request
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **Data Integration**
   - Use existing `maintenanceApi.getRequests()` function
   - Display real maintenance request data from database
   - Include related property and tenant information via API joins
   - Real-time status updates and data refresh capabilities

3. **Request Card Display**
   - Maintenance request title and description preview
   - Property information (name, address)
   - Tenant information (name, contact)
   - Status indicator with color coding
   - Priority level with appropriate visual indicators
   - Creation date and last updated timestamp
   - Status progression indicator

4. **Filtering and Search**
   - Filter by status (pending, approved, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Filter by priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
   - Search by maintenance title, property name, or tenant name
   - Clear filters option

5. **Status Management**
   - Quick status update actions from list items
   - Status change confirmations
   - Real-time status updates across the app

6. **Navigation and Interactions**
   - Tap request card to view detailed maintenance request screen
   - Swipe actions for quick status updates
   - Long press for additional options menu
   - Integration with existing app navigation structure

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Screen Structure**
   - Create `app/maintenance/index.tsx` as main maintenance requests screen
   - Use Material Design 3 components following app patterns
   - Implement ModernHeader with search and filter options

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Integrate `maintenanceApi.getRequests()` with useApi hook
   - Add loading states, error handling, and empty states
   - Implement pull-to-refresh with RefreshControl

3. **UI Components**
   - Create MaintenanceRequestCard component for list items
   - Implement FilterModal for status and priority filtering
   - Add SearchBar component for text search
   - Create StatusChip component for visual status indicators

4. **Filtering Logic**
   - Client-side filtering for search functionality
   - Server-side filtering for status and priority (if API supports)
   - Combine multiple filter types
   - Persist filter preferences

5. **Status Update Integration**
   - Quick action buttons for status changes
   - Confirmation dialogs for status updates
   - API integration for status updates
   - Optimistic UI updates

6. **Navigation Setup**
   - Add route to existing navigation structure
   - Ensure proper integration with sidebar navigation
   - Add navigation to detailed request view (future task)

## Test Plan

1. **API Integration Testing**
   - Verify `maintenanceApi.getRequests()` returns expected data structure
   - Test loading states during data fetching
   - Verify error handling for network failures
   - Test pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **UI Component Testing**
   - Verify maintenance request cards display all required information
   - Test filter functionality with different combinations
   - Verify search functionality works across multiple fields
   - Test status indicators display correctly

3. **Status Update Testing**
   - Test quick status update actions
   - Verify status changes reflect in UI immediately
   - Test error handling for failed status updates
   - Verify database updates persist correctly

4. **Navigation Testing**
   - Test navigation from sidebar to maintenance screen
   - Verify FAB navigation to add request form
   - Test card tap navigation to detail view
   - Verify back navigation works correctly

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with empty maintenance requests list
   - Test with very long property/tenant names
   - Test with network connectivity issues
   - Test with invalid or corrupted data
