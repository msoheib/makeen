## Requirements

### Core E2E Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Maintenance Workflow**
   - Create maintenance request
   - Update request status through all stages
   - Create work order from maintenance request
   - Assign contractor to work order
   - Update work order status to completion
   - Verify status updates and data consistency

2. **Property and Tenant Integration**
   - Verify property information displays correctly
   - Test tenant information and contact details
   - Validate property-tenant relationships
   - Test navigation to property and tenant profiles

3. **Status Management Testing**
   - Test all status transitions for maintenance requests
   - Test all status transitions for work orders
   - Verify status update modal functionality
   - Test batch status updates

4. **Filtering and Search Testing**
   - Test priority-based filtering
   - Test status-based filtering
   - Test combined filter scenarios
   - Test search across all text fields

### Data Integrity Testing
1. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create, read, update operations for maintenance requests
   - Create, read, update operations for work orders
   - Verify data persistence and synchronization
   - Test data validation and error handling

2. **Relationship Integrity**
   - Test maintenance request to work order relationships
   - Verify property to maintenance request links
   - Test tenant to maintenance request associations
   - Validate contractor assignment workflows

3. **API Integration**
   - Test all maintenance API endpoints
   - Verify error handling for API failures
   - Test loading states and user feedback
   - Validate data refresh and synchronization

### User Experience Testing
1. **Navigation and Flow**

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large datasets
   - Verify smooth scrolling and interactions
   - Test memory usage during extended use
   - Validate app performance under load

## Implementation Plan

1. **Manual E2E Testing**
   - Execute complete maintenance workflows
   - Test all user interface elements
   - Verify data accuracy and consistency
   - Document any issues or improvements

2. **Automated Test Development**
   - Create test scripts for critical workflows
   - Implement data validation tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Set up continuous testing integration

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Address any discovered bugs
   - Implement missing functionality
   - Optimize performance bottlenecks
   - Enhance user experience based on findings

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update test results documentation
   - Create user workflow guides
   - Document known limitations
   - Provide troubleshooting guides

## Test Plan

### Functional E2E Tests
1. **Happy Path Workflow**: Complete maintenance request to work order completion
2. **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, validation errors, edge cases
3. **User Permissions**: Different user role access and capabilities
4. **Data Synchronization**: Real-time updates and data consistency

### Integration Tests
1. **API Integration**: All maintenance-related API endpoints
2. **Database Operations**: Data persistence and retrieval
3. **Cross-Component Communication**: Screen-to-screen data flow
4. **Third-party Integrations**: Any external service dependencies

### Performance Tests
1. **Load Testing**: Large datasets and multiple concurrent operations
2. **Memory Usage**: Extended app usage and memory leaks
3. **Network Conditions**: Poor connectivity and offline scenarios
4. **Battery Usage**: Power consumption during extended use
