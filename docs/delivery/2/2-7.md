## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Loading State Management**
   - Loading indicators for all API operations
   - Skeleton screens for initial data loading
   - Progressive loading for large datasets
   - Loading state synchronization across components

2. **Error Handling**
   - Network error recovery mechanisms
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry functionality for failed operations
   - Offline state handling

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debounced search operations
   - Cached data management
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Background refresh capabilities

4. **User Feedback**
   - Success notifications for completed actions
   - Progress indicators for long operations
   - Error alerts with actionable options
   - Loading state preservation during navigation

### UI/UX Requirements
1. **Loading Indicators**
   - Spinner overlays for quick operations
   - Skeleton screens for content loading
   - Progress bars for file operations
   - Pull-to-refresh indicators

2. **Error Display**
   - Error boundary components
   - Inline error messages
   - Error state illustrations
   - Retry buttons and actions

3. **Responsive Feedback**
   - Immediate loading feedback
   - Non-blocking background operations
   - Graceful degradation for poor connections
   - Clear success confirmations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance useApi Hook**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add loading state management
   - Include success/error notifications

2. **Create Loading Components**
   - MaintenanceListSkeleton component
   - LoadingOverlay component
   - ErrorBoundary component
   - RetryableError component

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Global error handler
   - Network status monitoring
   - Error categorization and messaging
   - Automatic retry for transient errors

4. **Add User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for operations
   - Loading states for all buttons and forms
   - Progress indicators for bulk operations
   - Success/error animations

## Test Plan

### Functional Testing
1. **Loading States**: Verify all loading indicators work correctly
2. **Error Recovery**: Test error scenarios and retry mechanisms
3. **Network Conditions**: Test with poor/offline network conditions
4. **User Feedback**: Verify appropriate feedback for all operations

### Performance Testing
1. **Loading Performance**: Test loading speed optimization
2. **Memory Usage**: Verify efficient memory usage during loading
3. **Background Operations**: Test background refresh functionality

## Verification

- [ ] Loading states display correctly for all operations
- [ ] Error handling works for network and API errors
- [ ] Retry functionality works for failed operations
- [ ] User feedback provides clear operation status
- [ ] Performance optimizations improve user experience
- [ ] Offline/poor network scenarios handled gracefully
