# PBI-13: Safe Area Handling for Modern Mobile Devices

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-13)

## Overview

This PBI focuses on implementing proper safe area handling to ensure that the app header and navigation elements don't overlap with device cameras, notches, dynamic islands, or other system UI elements on modern mobile devices. This is critical for maintaining a professional user experience across different device types.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the app header may overlap with device cameras or notches on modern smartphones:
- iPhone devices with Face ID (X, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) have notches or Dynamic Island
- Many Android devices have punch-hole cameras or notches
- The hamburger menu, app title, and action buttons may be partially obscured
- Different devices have varying safe area requirements
- System status bar may also interfere with app content

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a user with a modern smartphone, I want all app interface elements to be fully visible and accessible so that I can interact with the app without any elements being hidden behind device cameras or system UI.

**Secondary User Stories:**
- As an iPhone user with a notch/Dynamic Island, I want proper spacing so content doesn't appear behind these elements
- As an Android user with a punch-hole camera, I want the header layout to accommodate the camera cutout
- As a user rotating my device, I want consistent safe area behavior in both orientations

## Technical Approach

### 1. Safe Area Implementation Strategy
- **Primary Tool**: React Native's `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context`
- **Status Bar**: Configure using `expo-status-bar` for consistent behavior
- **Platform Detection**: Handle iOS and Android differences appropriately
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Detect device capabilities and adjust layouts accordingly

### 2. Areas Requiring Safe Area Protection
- **App Header/Navigation Bar**: ModernHeader component
- **Drawer Layout**: Ensure proper spacing when drawer is open
- **Tab Navigation**: Bottom tab bar safe area handling
- **Modal/Overlay Components**: Future-proof for modal dialogs

### 3. Implementation Components
- **Enhanced ModernHeader**: Add safe area padding to header
- **Safe Area Provider**: Wrap main app layout with SafeAreaProvider
- **Layout Adjustments**: Modify drawer and tab layouts for safe areas
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure consistent behavior iOS/Android

## UX/UI Considerations

### 1. Visual Design Requirements
- **Consistent Spacing**: Maintain visual hierarchy with safe area padding
- **Platform Adherence**: Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design
- **Content Preservation**: Ensure no content is cut off or inaccessible
- **Smooth Transitions**: Safe area changes should not cause jarring layout shifts

### 2. User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Accessibility**: All touch targets remain accessible
- **Professional Appearance**: App looks polished on all device types
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Safe area handling should be invisible to users
- **Performance**: Safe area detection should not impact app performance

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **iOS Safe Area Support**
   - ✅ Proper spacing for devices with notches (iPhone X+)
   - ✅ Dynamic Island support for iPhone 14 Pro/15 Pro
   - ✅ Status bar integration without overlap
   - ✅ Correct behavior in portrait and landscape modes

2. **Android Safe Area Support**
   - ✅ Punch-hole camera accommodation
   - ✅ Various notch styles support
   - ✅ System navigation bar consideration
   - ✅ Different screen ratio handling

3. **Header Element Accessibility**
   - ✅ Hamburger menu fully clickable and visible
   - ✅ App title completely readable
   - ✅ Action buttons accessible
   - ✅ No overlap with device cameras or system UI

4. **Layout Consistency**
   - ✅ Consistent padding across all screens
   - ✅ Smooth transitions between screens
   - ✅ No content cutoff or inaccessibility
   - ✅ Proper drawer and tab navigation spacing

5. **Cross-Device Compatibility**
   - ✅ Works on devices without notches/cameras
   - ✅ Graceful degradation on older devices
   - ✅ Future-proofed for new device types
   - ✅ Performance remains optimal

## Dependencies

- **react-native-safe-area-context**: For safe area detection and components
- **expo-status-bar**: For status bar configuration
- **Current Navigation Structure**: Drawer + Tab layout must be preserved
- **Existing Components**: ModernHeader, SideBar components require updates

## Open Questions

1. **Landscape Mode Priority**: Should we prioritize landscape mode support or focus on portrait first?
2. **Custom Insets**: Do we need custom inset handling for specific design requirements?
3. **Animation Considerations**: How should safe area changes animate during orientation changes?
4. **Testing Strategy**: What device simulator combinations should we test?
