# PBI-15: Contract Management System

## Overview

This PBI implements a comprehensive contract management system that allows property managers to create, view, edit, and track all rental and sales agreements through dedicated screens. The system provides complete lifecycle management for property contracts with proper integration to existing APIs.

## Problem Statement

The current application lacks dedicated contract management screens, causing navigation failures when users try to access contract-related functionality. Property managers need a centralized system to manage all rental and sales agreements, track contract status, and maintain proper documentation.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a property manager**, I want to manage rental and sales contracts through dedicated screens so that I can create, view, edit, and track all property agreements and their lifecycle.

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a property manager**, I want to view all contracts in a searchable list so that I can quickly find specific agreements
- **As a property manager**, I want to create new contracts with proper property and tenant selection so that I can formalize rental arrangements
- **As a property owner**, I want to view contracts for my properties so that I can monitor tenant agreements
- **As a tenant**, I want to view my rental contract details so that I can reference agreement terms

## Technical Approach

### Database Integration
- Utilizes existing `contracts` table with full relationship mapping
- Leverages `contractsApi` functions from existing API layer
- Integrates with `properties` and `profiles` tables for complete data context

### Screen Architecture
```
app/contracts/
├── index.tsx          # Contract listing with search/filter
├── [id].tsx          # Contract details view
├── add.tsx           # Create new contract form
└── edit/
    └── [id].tsx      # Edit existing contract
```

### API Integration
- `contractsApi.getAll()` - List all contracts with filtering
- `contractsApi.getById()` - Get contract details with relationships
- `contractsApi.create()` - Create new contracts
- `contractsApi.update()` - Update existing contracts
- `contractsApi.getByProperty()` - Property-specific contracts
- `contractsApi.getByTenant()` - Tenant-specific contracts

## UX/UI Considerations

### Design Consistency
- Follows Material Design 3 patterns used throughout the app
- Uses existing component library (`ModernHeader`, `ModernCard`, etc.)
- Maintains consistent color scheme and typography
- Implements proper loading states and error handling

### Navigation Integration
- Accessible through sidebar navigation
- Deep linking support for contract details
- Proper back navigation patterns
- Integration with property and people detail screens

### User Experience Features
- Search functionality across contract details
- Filter by contract type, status, and date ranges
- Status indicators and progress tracking
- Document attachment and management
- Contract renewal and termination workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

### Contract Listing Screen
- ✅ Display all contracts with property and tenant information
- ✅ Search functionality across contract details
- ✅ Filter by contract type (rental, sale, management)
- ✅ Filter by status (active, expired, terminated, renewal)
- ✅ Sort by date, property, or tenant
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh capability

### Contract Details View
- ✅ Complete contract information display
- ✅ Property and tenant relationship data
- ✅ Contract terms and financial details
- ✅ Document attachments and files
- ✅ Status tracking and history
- ✅ Actions (edit, renew, terminate)

### Create Contract Form
- ✅ Property selection from available properties

- ✅ Contract type selection (rental, sale, management)
- ✅ Financial terms input (rent, deposit, fees)
- ✅ Date selection (start, end, renewal dates)
- ✅ Terms and conditions input
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Document upload capability

### Contract Editing
- ✅ Edit all contract fields
- ✅ Version tracking for changes
- ✅ Approval workflows for modifications
- ✅ Audit trail for contract changes
- ✅ Proper validation and data integrity

### Integration Requirements
- ✅ Seamless integration with properties and profiles APIs
- ✅ Document management system integration
- ✅ Financial system integration for rent tracking
- ✅ Notification system for contract events

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing `contracts` table in database
- `contractsApi` functions in API layer
- `properties` and `profiles` table relationships
- Document management system
- Navigation system and routing

### Business Dependencies
- Property data must exist for contract creation
- Tenant profiles must be approved for rental contracts
- Chart of accounts for financial tracking
- Document upload and storage system

## Open Questions

1. **Contract Templates**: Should we provide pre-defined contract templates for different property types?
2. **Digital Signatures**: Do we need digital signature integration for contract execution?
3. **Automatic Renewals**: Should the system support automatic contract renewal workflows?
4. **Contract Approvals**: Do contracts require manager approval before activation?
5. **Integration Scope**: Should contracts integrate with external legal document systems?
