## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Display all contracts in a scrollable list with key information
- Search functionality across contract number, property title, and tenant name
- Filter options by contract type, status, and date ranges
- Sort contracts by creation date, start date, or property name
- Pull-to-refresh capability for data updates
- Navigation to contract details view
- Integration with existing contracts API

### Technical Requirements
- Use `contractsApi.getAll()` for data fetching
- Implement `useApi` hook pattern for state management
- Follow Material Design 3 component patterns
- Use `ModernHeader` component for consistent navigation
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### UI/UX Requirements
- Consistent with other listing screens (tenants, properties)
- Contract cards showing essential information at a glance
- Status indicators with appropriate colors
- Search bar with clear placeholder text
- Filter UI with expandable/collapsible sections
- Empty state for no contracts found

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Screen Structure
1. Create `app/contracts/index.tsx` file
2. Set up basic component structure with imports
3. Implement `ModernHeader` with title and navigation
4. Add basic layout structure for content area

### Phase 2: Data Integration
1. Integrate `useApi` hook with `contractsApi.getAll()`
2. Implement loading states with ActivityIndicator
3. Add error handling with user-friendly messages
4. Implement pull-to-refresh functionality

### Phase 3: Contract List Implementation
1. Create contract card component design
2. Display contract information (number, property, tenant, dates, status)
3. Add navigation to contract details on card tap
4. Implement proper list performance with FlatList

### Phase 4: Search and Filter Functionality
1. Add search TextInput with real-time filtering
2. Implement filter UI with contract type selection
3. Add status filter options
4. Implement date range filtering capability
5. Add sort options with dropdown selection

### Phase 5: UI Polish and Testing
1. Add proper spacing and typography
2. Implement status color coding
3. Add empty state handling
4. Test on different screen sizes
5. Verify accessibility features

## Verification

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Screen displays list of all contracts with essential information
- ✅ Search functionality works across contract details
- ✅ Filter options properly narrow down results
- ✅ Loading states and error handling work correctly
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh updates the contract list
- ✅ Tapping contract navigates to details view
- ✅ UI is consistent with app design patterns
- ✅ Performance is smooth with large contract lists

### Test Cases
1. **Data Loading**: Verify contracts load correctly on screen mount
2. **Search Functionality**: Test search across contract number, property, tenant
3. **Filter Operations**: Test all filter combinations work correctly
4. **Navigation**: Verify tapping contract card navigates to details
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior with network errors
6. **Empty States**: Verify appropriate messages for no contracts/no results
7. **Pull-to-Refresh**: Test data refresh functionality
8. **Performance**: Test smooth scrolling with many contracts

## Files Modified

### Files Created
- ✅ `app/contracts/index.tsx` - Main contracts listing screen with search, filtering, and card-based display
- ✅ `app/contracts/_layout.tsx` - Layout configuration for contracts route
- ✅ `app/contracts/[id].tsx` - Contract details screen (placeholder implementation)
- ✅ `app/contracts/add.tsx` - Add contract screen (placeholder implementation)

### Components Created
- ✅ `ContractCard` - Individual contract display component with status indicators and navigation
- ✅ Search and filter UI components (Menu dropdowns for contract type and status)

## Implementation Summary

**Contracts Listing Screen Features:**
- ✅ **Search functionality** - Search across contract numbers, property titles, tenant names, and email addresses
- ✅ **Advanced filtering** - Filter by contract type (rental/sale/management) and status (active/expired/terminated/renewal/draft)

- ✅ **Status indicators** - Color-coded status chips with appropriate icons (active=green, expired=red, etc.)
- ✅ **Navigation integration** - Links to contract details and add contract screens
- ✅ **Loading states** - Proper loading indicators and error handling
- ✅ **Pull-to-refresh** - Gesture-based data refresh
- ✅ **Empty state handling** - Contextual messaging based on search/filter state
- ✅ **Material Design 3** - Consistent theming and component usage

**Additional Screens:**
- ✅ **Contract Details** - Comprehensive details view with placeholder data
- ✅ **Add Contract** - Placeholder screen for future contract creation functionality
- ✅ **Route Layout** - Proper navigation structure for contracts section

## Dependencies

- Existing `contractsApi.getAll()` function
