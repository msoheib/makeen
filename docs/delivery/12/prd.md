# PBI-12: Splash Screen with App Logo and Initialization

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-12)

## Overview

Implement a professional splash screen that displays when the app launches, featuring the Real Estate MG logo and handling app initialization tasks. This provides users with a polished startup experience while giving the app time to load essential resources and establish database connections.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the app launches directly to the main interface without any branding or initialization screen. This can result in:
- Jarring user experience during app startup
- No visual feedback during app initialization
- Missing opportunity for professional branding
- Potential UI glitches if the app renders before resources are loaded
- No graceful handling of startup tasks like authentication checks

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a user**, I want to see a professional splash screen with the app logo when launching the application so that I experience a polished startup sequence and the app has time to initialize properly.

### Supporting User Stories
- **As a user**, I want the splash screen to display for an appropriate duration so that I see the branding but don't wait unnecessarily long
- **As a user**, I want smooth transitions from splash to main app so that the experience feels seamless
- **As a developer**, I want the splash screen to handle app initialization tasks so that the main app is ready when displayed

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Expo SplashScreen Integration**: Utilize Expo's built-in splash screen capabilities for native platform integration
2. **Custom Splash Component**: Create a React component for additional initialization logic and custom branding
3. **App State Management**: Implement initialization state tracking to control splash visibility
4. **Asset Management**: Proper loading and display of app logo and branding assets

### Technology Stack
- **Expo SplashScreen**: Native splash screen management
- **React Native**: Custom splash screen component
- **React Native Paper**: Consistent Material Design 3 theming
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation
- **Expo Fonts**: Custom font loading if needed

### Architecture Components
```

│   ├── app.json configuration
│   └── Platform-specific assets
├── Custom SplashScreen Component
│   ├── Logo display
│   ├── Loading indicators
│   └── Initialization logic
└── App State Management
    ├── Initialization tracking
    ├── Resource loading
    └── Transition control
```

## UX/UI Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Branding**: Prominent display of Real Estate MG logo
- **Loading Indicators**: Subtle animation to show app is loading
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with app theme (Material Design 3)
- **Typography**: Professional font selection matching app design
- **Layout**: Centered logo with appropriate spacing and proportions

### User Experience
- **Duration**: 2-3 seconds minimum, extending as needed for initialization
- **Transitions**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations
- **Feedback**: Visual indication that app is loading/initializing
- **Consistency**: Same experience across iOS and Android platforms

### Accessibility
- **Screen Readers**: Proper accessibility labels for splash content
- **High Contrast**: Logo visibility in different accessibility modes
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for reduced animations

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [ ] Splash screen displays immediately when app launches
- [ ] Real Estate MG logo/branding prominently displayed
- [ ] Smooth transition from splash to main application
- [ ] Configurable splash duration (minimum 2 seconds)
- [ ] Loading indicator shows app is initializing

### ✅ Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integration with Expo SplashScreen API
- [ ] Custom splash screen component with initialization logic
- [ ] Proper asset management for logo/branding
- [ ] App state management for initialization tracking
- [ ] Error handling for initialization failures

### ✅ User Experience
- [ ] Professional, polished appearance
- [ ] Consistent with app's Material Design 3 theme
- [ ] No jarring transitions or flickers
- [ ] Works correctly on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Respects accessibility preferences

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Fast splash screen display (< 500ms to show)
- [ ] Efficient resource loading during splash
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues
- [ ] Smooth animations without frame drops

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Expo SplashScreen API
- React Native Reanimated (for animations)
- App logo/branding assets

### Internal Dependencies
- App state management system
- Theme system integration
- Navigation structure
- Error handling framework

## Open Questions

1. **Logo Design**: Do we have finalized logo assets for splash screen display?
2. **Animation Complexity**: Should the splash include animated elements or remain static?
3. **Initialization Tasks**: What specific initialization tasks should be performed during splash?
4. **Offline Handling**: How should the splash behave when offline or with poor connectivity?
5. **Error States**: Should splash screen handle and display initialization errors?
