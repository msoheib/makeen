# PBI-11: PDF Report Generation and Download System

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-11)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive PDF report generation and download system that creates professional PDF documents with charts, data tables, and branding. This system will use Supabase Edge Functions for server-side PDF generation to ensure high-quality output and proper handling of complex layouts.

## Problem Statement

The current reports screen displays data but lacks proper PDF export functionality. While task 4-7 was marked as "Done", the actual implementation only generates text content rather than professional PDF documents. Property managers need high-quality PDF reports with charts, tables, and professional formatting that can be shared with stakeholders, printed, or archived.

**Current Issues:**
- Download button in reports screen is non-functional
- Existing `lib/pdfGenerator.ts` only creates text content, not actual PDFs
- No server-side PDF generation infrastructure
- Missing professional formatting and chart integration

## User Stories

- As a property manager, I want to download professional PDF reports so I can share analytics with stakeholders
- As a property manager, I want PDF reports to include charts and visual data so stakeholders can easily understand the information
- As a property manager, I want PDF reports with company branding so they look professional and official
- As a property manager, I want to download reports for specific date ranges so I can analyze particular periods
- As a property manager, I want progress indicators during PDF generation so I know the system is working
- As an accountant, I want to export financial reports to PDF for compliance and record-keeping purposes

## Technical Approach

### Architecture: Server-Side PDF Generation

**Server-Side (Supabase Edge Functions)**
- Create dedicated Edge Function for PDF generation using Puppeteer
- Direct database access for complex queries and data aggregation
- Professional PDF templates with HTML/CSS for precise formatting
- Chart-to-image conversion for visual data inclusion
- Security: Financial data processing stays server-side

**Client-Side (React Native)**
- Trigger PDF generation requests to Edge Function
- Handle file download and device storage using Expo File System
- Provide user feedback during generation process
- Share functionality via native sharing APIs

### PDF Generation Pipeline
1. **Client Request**: User taps download button with report parameters
2. **Edge Function**: Receives request, queries database, generates PDF
3. **File Return**: Edge Function returns PDF blob to client
4. **Download**: Client saves PDF to device and provides sharing options

## UX/UI Considerations

- **Download Button Integration**: Replace existing non-functional download buttons in reports screens
- **Progress Indicators**: Show PDF generation progress with loading states
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation when PDF is ready with options to view/share
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for generation failures
- **File Naming**: Descriptive file names with timestamps for easy organization
- **Professional Design**: Company branding, consistent formatting, clear layouts

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **PDF Generation Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Supabase Edge Function created for PDF generation
   - ✅ Professional PDF templates with company branding
   - ✅ Chart-to-image conversion functionality
   - ✅ Database integration for all report types

2. **Client-Side Integration**
   - ✅ Download buttons in all report screens are functional
   - ✅ Progress indicators during PDF generation
   - ✅ File download and save to device capabilities
   - ✅ Native sharing functionality for generated PDFs

3. **Report Coverage**
   - ✅ Revenue reports with financial charts and data tables
   - ✅ Expense reports with category breakdowns
   - ✅ Property performance reports with ROI calculations
   - ✅ Tenant demographics and payment analysis
   - ✅ Maintenance cost analysis with visual charts

4. **Quality and User Experience**
   - ✅ Professional PDF formatting with proper layouts
   - ✅ Charts and visual data accurately rendered in PDFs
   - ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - ✅ Date range filtering support in PDF exports
   - ✅ Responsive file naming with timestamps

5. **Testing and Verification**
   - ✅ All report types can be exported to PDF successfully
   - ✅ Generated PDFs are viewable and shareable on devices
   - ✅ Error scenarios handled gracefully
   - ✅ Performance optimization for large reports

## Dependencies

- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Deno runtime for server-side execution
- **Puppeteer**: PDF generation from HTML/CSS templates
- **Expo File System**: Client-side file operations
- **Expo Sharing**: Native sharing capabilities
- **Chart.js or Canvas API**: Chart-to-image conversion
- **Existing Reports API**: Data source for PDF content

## Open Questions

- Should we implement PDF caching to improve performance?
- Do we need PDF template customization options?
- Should we support batch PDF generation for multiple reports?
- Do we need password protection for sensitive financial PDFs?
