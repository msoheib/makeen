# PBI-11: PDF Report Generation and Download System

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-11)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive PDF report generation and download system that transforms the current static reports into downloadable PDF documents with professional formatting, charts, and company branding. This system will utilize Supabase Edge Functions for server-side PDF generation and provide seamless download/sharing capabilities on the client side.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the reports screen displays data in a visual format but lacks the ability to generate downloadable PDF reports. Property managers and accountants need to:
- Share reports with stakeholders outside the app
- Maintain offline records for compliance and archival purposes
- Generate professional-looking documents with company branding
- Export data in a standardized format for external analysis

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a property manager**, I want to generate and download professional PDF reports with charts and data so that I can share comprehensive analytics with stakeholders and maintain offline records.

### Supporting User Stories
- **As an accountant**, I want to export financial reports as PDFs so that I can include them in official documentation
- **As a property manager**, I want PDF reports to include charts and visual data so that they're easy to understand
- **As a user**, I want the PDF generation to show progress indicators so that I know the system is working
- **As a user**, I want to be able to share generated PDFs directly from the app

## Technical Approach

### Server-Side PDF Generation
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Deploy Edge Function using Deno runtime with Puppeteer for PDF generation
- **Database Integration**: Connect Edge Function to Supabase database for real-time data fetching
- **Template System**: Create HTML templates for different report types with CSS styling
- **Chart Generation**: Use Chart.js or similar library to generate charts within PDFs

### Client-Side Integration
- **API Layer**: Create `pdfApi.ts` service to handle PDF generation requests
- **Download Management**: Implement file download and sharing using React Native capabilities
- **Progress Indicators**: Show loading states and progress during PDF generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## UX/UI Considerations

- Replace current console.log download buttons with functional PDF generation
- Show loading indicators during PDF generation (estimated 3-5 seconds)
- Display success/error messages in Arabic for user feedback
- Provide options to download or share generated PDFs
- Maintain consistent Material Design 3 styling in PDF templates

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Server-side PDF generation using Supabase Edge Functions with Puppeteer
- ✅ Professional PDF templates with company branding and charts
- ✅ Client-side download and sharing functionality
- ✅ Support for all report types (revenue, expenses, properties, tenants, maintenance)
- ✅ Real PDF files with proper formatting and layouts
- ✅ Progress indicators and error handling
- ✅ E2E testing of PDF generation and download workflow

## Dependencies

- Supabase project with Edge Functions capability
- Puppeteer library for server-side PDF generation
- React Native file system and sharing capabilities
- Existing reports API and database integration

## Open Questions

- Should PDFs include interactive elements or remain static?
- What level of customization should be available for PDF templates?
- Should we implement PDF caching for frequently requested reports?
