# [14-1] User Context API Integration

## Description

**CRITICAL SECURITY TASK**: The current API layer completely ignores user context, allowing all users to see the same global data regardless of their role. This task implements user context integration into all API functions to enable role-based data filtering and prevent unauthorized data access.

This is the foundational security task that enables all other role-based access controls.

## Requirements

### Primary Security Requirements:
1. **User Context Parameter**: All API functions must accept current user context (user ID, role, profile data)
2. **Authentication Validation**: Every API call must validate user authentication status
3. **Role-Based Query Logic**: Implement conditional query logic based on user role
4. **Data Isolation**: Ensure complete data separation between different user roles
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain admin functionality while securing other roles

### Specific API Function Updates Required:

#### **Properties API**:
- `getAll()` - Filter by ownership (owners) or availability (tenants)
- `getDashboardSummary()` - Scope to user's accessible properties only
- `getById()` - Verify user has access to specific property

#### **Profiles API**:
- `getTenants()` - Filter to only tenants of user's properties (owners) or own profile (tenants)
- `getAll()` - Scope based on user role and relationships

#### **Financial APIs**:
- `vouchersApi.getAll()` - Filter by property ownership and tenant relationships
- `invoicesApi.getAll()` - Show only invoices related to user's properties/contracts
- `reportsApi.*` - All report functions must scope data to user context

#### **Maintenance APIs**:
- `getRequests()` - Filter by property ownership (owners) or tenant ID (tenants)
- `getWorkOrders()` - Scope to user's accessible properties

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core User Context Infrastructure
1. **Create UserContext Interface**: Define TypeScript interface for user context data
2. **Modify API Function Signatures**: Add optional `userContext` parameter to all API functions
3. **Authentication Helper**: Create utility to get current authenticated user context
4. **Role Detection Logic**: Implement role-based conditional query building

### Phase 2: Properties API Security
1. **Properties Filtering Logic**: 
   - Owners: `WHERE owner_id = userContext.userId`
   - Tenants: `WHERE status = 'available' OR id IN (tenant's rented properties)`
   - Admins: No filtering (current behavior)
2. **Dashboard Summary Security**: Scope all statistics to user's accessible data
3. **Property Details Access Control**: Verify access rights before returning property details

### Phase 3: User Management API Security
1. **Profiles/Tenants Filtering**: 
   - Owners: Only show tenants of their properties
   - Tenants: Only show their own profile
   - Admins: Show all profiles
2. **Relationship-Based Queries**: Use contract/property relationships for filtering

### Phase 4: Financial Data Security
1. **Vouchers Filtering**: Link vouchers to properties and filter by ownership/tenancy
2. **Invoices Filtering**: Filter invoices based on property access rights  
3. **Reports Security**: All report data must be scoped to user's accessible properties

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each API function with different user roles
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify no data leakage between roles
3. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive review of all API endpoints

## Verification

### Test Cases:
1. **Tenant Role Testing**:
   - Verify tenants only see their rented property + available properties
   - Confirm tenants cannot access other tenants' data
   - Validate tenants cannot see financial data they don't own

2. **Owner Role Testing**:
   - Verify owners only see properties they own
   - Confirm owners see only their properties' tenants and contracts
   - Validate owners cannot see other owners' properties

3. **Admin Role Testing**:
   - Verify admins maintain full access to all data
   - Confirm no functionality is broken for admin users

4. **Cross-Role Security Testing**:
   - Attempt to access unauthorized data with different user contexts
   - Verify proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Performance Testing:
1. **Query Performance**: Ensure role-based filtering doesn't significantly impact performance
2. **Database Load**: Monitor database query efficiency with additional WHERE clauses
3. **API Response Times**: Verify response times remain acceptable

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… **COMPLETED: Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control System**

**Updated: Admin/Manager Full Access Implementation** (Jan 27, 2025)

**Enhanced Admin/Manager Permissions:**
1. **Bypass Security Filters**: Admin and manager roles bypass all data filtering (`buildRoleBasedFilter` returns `null`)
2. **Full Screen Access**: Added `isAdminOrManager()` helper that grants immediate access to all screens
3. **Complete Navigation Access**: Admin/manager see all sidebar and tab navigation items
4. **Expanded Permissions**: Added missing screens (accounts, cost-centers, fixed-assets, contracts, reservations)
5. **Enhanced Tab Access**: Added finance, documents, people, and payments tabs for admin/manager
6. **Simplified Permission Logic**: Clear hierarchy where admin/manager have precedence over all permission checks

**Core Security Infrastructure:**
1. **UserContext Interface** (`lib/types.ts`): Complete type definitions for user context with role, profile, and property relationships
2. **Security Helper Functions** (`lib/security.ts`): 
   - `getCurrentUserContext()` - Fetches authenticated user with role and property relationships
   - `buildRoleBasedFilter()` - Creates role-specific query filters for database operations (admin/manager bypass)
   - `hasPropertyAccess()` & `validateUserAction()` - Access validation functions (admin/manager bypass)
   - Automatic profile creation for auth users without profile records
   - Security logging and performance considerations

**Permissions System** (`lib/permissions.ts`): 
- Complete role-based permissions configuration
- Screen-level access control (dashboard, reports, tenants, properties, etc.)
- Navigation filtering for sidebar and bottom tabs
- Permission helper functions and hooks

**API Layer Security:**
1. **Properties API Secured**:
   - `getAll()` - Owners see only their properties, tenants see rented + available properties
   - `getById()` - Validates user access to specific property
   - `getDashboardSummary()` - Scopes statistics to user's accessible data only
