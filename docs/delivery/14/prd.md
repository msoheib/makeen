# PBI-14: **CRITICAL SECURITY** - Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED**: The current application allows all users to see the same data regardless of their role. This is a major security issue where tenants could see all properties, financial data, and other users' private information. Property owners could see other owners' properties and financial information. This PBI addresses this critical security flaw by implementing proper role-based access control throughout the application.

## Problem Statement

### Current Security Issues:
1. **Global Data Access**: All API functions return global data without user context filtering
2. **No Role Restrictions**: Tenants can see all properties, all tenants, all financial data
3. **Data Leakage**: Property owners can see other owners' properties and financial information
4. **Static Data Usage**: Many screens use hardcoded static data, masking the underlying security issues
5. **Missing RLS**: Row Level Security policies not properly implemented at database level
6. **UI Permission Issues**: No role-based UI element visibility controls

### Impact:
- **Privacy Breach**: Users can access confidential information they shouldn't see
- **Regulatory Compliance Risk**: Potential GDPR/data protection violations
- **Business Risk**: Competitive information exposure between property owners
- **Trust Issues**: Tenants seeing other tenants' personal and financial information

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories:
- **As a tenant**: I want to see only my rented property and available properties for browsing, so my privacy is protected and I'm not overwhelmed with irrelevant data
- **As a property owner**: I want to see only my own properties and related data, so my business information remains confidential
- **As an admin**: I want to see all data for management purposes, maintaining the current functionality
- **As any user**: I want to be confident that my personal and financial data is secure and not visible to unauthorized users

### Security Requirements:
- **Data Isolation**: Each user role must have strict data access boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: All data access must be logged and traceable
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum necessary access for their role

## Technical Approach

### 1. API Layer Security Enhancement
- **User Context Integration**: Modify all API functions to accept and filter by current user context
- **Role-Based Filtering**: Implement role-specific query filters in the API layer
- **Authentication Validation**: Ensure all API calls validate user authentication status

### 2. Database Security Implementation
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implement comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- **User Context Policies**: Create policies that filter data based on authenticated user
- **Permission Matrix**: Define clear data access rules for each role

### 3. Frontend Security Controls
- **Dynamic UI**: Show/hide UI elements based on user role capabilities
- **Route Protection**: Implement route-level access controls
- **Data Display Filtering**: Ensure frontend only displays authorized data

### 4. Role-Specific Data Access Rules

#### **Tenant Role Access**:
- **Properties**: Only their rented property + available properties (status = 'available')
- **Tenants**: Only their own profile
- **Contracts**: Only their own contracts
- **Maintenance**: Only their own maintenance requests
- **Financial**: Only their own invoices/payments
- **Reports**: No access to reports section
- **Documents**: Only documents related to their property/contracts

#### **Owner Role Access**:
- **Properties**: Only properties they own (where owner_id = user.id)
- **Tenants**: Only tenants of their properties
- **Contracts**: Only contracts for their properties
- **Maintenance**: Only maintenance requests for their properties  
- **Financial**: Only financial data related to their properties
- **Reports**: Only reports for their properties
- **Documents**: Only documents related to their properties

#### **Admin Role Access**:
- **All Data**: Complete access to all entities (current behavior)
- **User Management**: Ability to manage user roles and permissions
- **System Configuration**: Access to all administrative functions

## UX/UI Considerations

### Navigation Modifications:
- **Role-Based Menu**: Customize sidebar menu based on user role
- **Feature Hiding**: Hide inaccessible features rather than showing errors
- **Dashboard Customization**: Role-specific dashboard content

### User Experience Improvements:
- **Clear Boundaries**: Make it obvious what data scope the user is viewing
- **Role Indicators**: Show current user role and permissions clearly
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle permission errors gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Security Requirements:
1. **API Security**: All API functions must filter data based on current user role
2. **Database Security**: RLS policies implemented for all tables
3. **Frontend Security**: UI elements hidden/shown based on role capabilities
4. **Role Separation**: Complete data isolation between different user roles
5. **Authentication**: All secure endpoints require valid authentication

### Tenant-Specific Requirements:
1. Tenants see only their rented property + available properties
2. Tenants cannot access reports, financial summaries, or other users' data
3. Tenants can only create maintenance requests for their property
4. Tenants cannot see other tenants' information

### Owner-Specific Requirements:
1. Property owners see only their own properties and related data
2. Owners can access financial reports only for their properties
3. Owners can add new properties (linked to their account)
4. Owners cannot see other owners' properties or financial data

### Admin Requirements:
1. Admins maintain current full access functionality
2. Admins can manage user roles and permissions
3. System-wide reports and analytics available to admins

### Testing Requirements:
1. **Cross-Role Testing**: Verify no data leakage between roles
2. **Permission Testing**: Test all UI elements and API endpoints for proper access control
3. **Database Testing**: Verify RLS policies work correctly
4. **Authentication Testing**: Test with different user roles and authentication states

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies:
- Supabase RLS policy implementation
- User authentication system enhancement
- API function refactoring for user context
- Frontend role management system

### Data Dependencies:
- User profile data with correct role assignments
- Property ownership relationships properly established
- Contract relationships between tenants and properties

## Open Questions

1. **Migration Strategy**: How to handle existing users without disrupting current functionality?
2. **Admin Override**: Should admins have the ability to temporarily view data as other user types?
3. **Audit Logging**: What level of access logging is required for compliance?
4. **Performance Impact**: How will role-based filtering affect query performance?
5. **Testing Users**: How to create test users for different roles during development?
