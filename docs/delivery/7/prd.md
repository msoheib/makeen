# PBI-7: Document Management System

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-7)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive document management system that allows property managers to view, organize, and access all property-related documents with efficient search and categorization capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Property managers need a centralized system to manage various types of documents including contracts, invoices, receipts, property images, and reports. The current application lacked document management capabilities, making it difficult to organize and retrieve important files efficiently.

## User Stories

- As a property manager, I want to view all documents in one place so I can access files quickly
- As a property manager, I want to filter documents by type so I can find specific document categories
- As a property manager, I want to search documents so I can locate files by name, uploader, or related property
- As a property manager, I want to see document metadata so I can understand file details and relationships
- As a property manager, I want to see document statistics so I can track storage usage and uploads

## Technical Approach

- Utilize existing `documentsApi.getAll()` function from `lib/api.ts`
- Implement document listing with type-based filtering
- Create search functionality across document metadata
- Display document statistics and usage information
- Integrate with properties and tenant data for context
- Support multiple document types with appropriate icons and colors

## UX/UI Considerations

- Follow existing app design patterns and Material Design 3 components
- Implement type-based color coding for easy document identification
- Provide intuitive filtering with segmented buttons
- Include comprehensive search across multiple fields
- Display file metadata clearly (size, date, uploader)
- Use responsive card-based layout for document items

## Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… Document listing screen displays all documents from database
2. âœ… Document type filtering allows quick categorization (contracts, invoices, receipts, images, reports, other)
3. âœ… Search functionality filters documents by name, uploader, property, or tenant
4. âœ… Document metadata displays file size, upload date, and uploader information
5. âœ… Document statistics show total count, monthly uploads, and storage usage
6. âœ… Type-specific icons and color coding for visual organization
7. âœ… Integration with properties and tenant data for context
8. âœ… Loading states and error handling implemented
9. âœ… Responsive design works across different screen sizes

## Dependencies

- Existing `lib/api.ts` documents API functions
- Existing `hooks/useApi.ts` custom hooks
- Supabase database with documents table
- Properties and profiles API integration for related data
- Material Design 3 component library

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

**Core Functionality:**
- Document listing with real database integration
- Type-based filtering system (all, contract, invoice, receipt, image, report, other)
- Comprehensive search across document fields
- Document statistics calculation
- File size formatting and date display
- Type-specific visual indicators

**Technical Implementation:**
- Connected to `documentsApi.getAll()` API endpoint
- Data transformation from database format to UI format
- Real-time filtering and search capabilities
- Error handling and loading states
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

**UI/UX Implementation:**
- Material Design 3 card-based layout
- Color-coded document types with appropriate icons
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Search input with real-time filtering
- Statistics cards showing usage metrics
- Proper navigation integration

### ðŸš§ Future Enhancements

**Potential Additions:**
- Document upload functionality
- Document preview capabilities
- Bulk operations (delete, move, share)
- Advanced filtering by date ranges
- Document sharing and export features
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Document version control

## Open Questions

- Should we implement document upload in a future PBI?
- Do we need document preview functionality?
- Should we add document sharing capabilities?
- Is document version control required?

## Related Tasks

This PBI was implemented as a complete feature without formal task breakdown, following the comprehensive implementation pattern. Future enhancements should follow proper task-driven development.

## Files Modified

### Primary Files
- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/documents.tsx` - Complete document management interface (460 lines)

### Supporting Files
- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tab configuration for documents screen
- `components/SideBar.tsx` - Navigation routing for document access

### API Integration
- `lib/api.ts` - Utilized existing `documentsApi.getAll()` function
- `lib/database.types.ts` - Used existing document types
- `hooks/useApi.ts` - Leveraged existing API state management
