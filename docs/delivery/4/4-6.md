[Back to task list](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive date range filtering functionality for all reports screens to allow property managers to analyze data for specific time periods. This includes predefined quick filters (This Month, Last Month, This Quarter, This Year) and custom date range selection capabilities.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Date Range Picker Component** (`components/DateRangePicker.tsx`)
   - Custom date range selection with start and end dates
   - Predefined quick filters (Today, This Week, This Month, Last Month, This Quarter, Last Quarter, This Year, Last Year)
   - Date validation and error handling
   - Material Design 3 styling with calendar integration

2. **Filter Integration for All Report Screens**
   - Add date range filtering to all existing report screens:
     - Financial reports (revenue, expense, profit-loss, cash-flow)
     - Property performance analytics screens
     - Tenant occupancy reports
     - Maintenance cost analysis
   - Consistent filter UI placement and behavior

3. **API Enhancement**
   - Update all report API functions to accept date range parameters
   - Implement server-side date filtering for efficiency
   - Add date range validation in API layer
   - Maintain backward compatibility for reports without date filters

4. **Filter State Management**
   - Remember selected date range across navigation within reports section
   - Reset to default when switching between different report types
   - Persist user preferences for default date range

### Technical Requirements
1. Create reusable `DateRangePicker` component with TypeScript interfaces
2. Extend all report API functions with optional `startDate` and `endDate` parameters
3. Implement consistent filter UI header component for reports
4. Add loading states during filter application
5. Include clear filter and reset to default functionality

### UX Requirements
1. Filter should be easily accessible at the top of each report screen
2. Loading indicators should show when applying filters
3. Clear visual feedback when filters are active
4. Easy access to common date ranges (last 30 days, this quarter, etc.)
5. Responsive design for both portrait and landscape orientations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Development
1. Create `DateRangePicker` component with calendar integration
2. Build predefined quick filter buttons
3. Implement date validation and error handling
4. Add TypeScript interfaces for date range data

### Phase 2: API Enhancement
1. Update `reportsApi` functions to accept date range parameters
2. Modify database queries to filter by date ranges
3. Add date range validation in API layer
4. Test API functions with various date range scenarios

### Phase 3: Screen Integration
1. Add date range picker to financial report screens
2. Integrate filtering with property performance analytics
3. Add filtering to tenant occupancy reports
4. Integrate with maintenance cost analysis
5. Ensure consistent placement and behavior across all screens

### Phase 4: State Management & Testing
1. Implement filter state persistence within reports session
2. Add loading states and error handling for filter operations
3. Test date range filtering with real data
4. Verify performance with large date ranges
5. Test edge cases (invalid dates, future dates, etc.)

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that date range filtering works correctly across all report screens and provides accurate, filtered data results.

### Test Scope
- Date range picker component functionality
- API filtering accuracy
- Integration with all report screens
- Loading states and error handling
- User experience and navigation

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Component Testing**
   - Verify date picker opens and allows date selection
   - Test predefined quick filter buttons work correctly
   - Confirm date validation prevents invalid ranges
   - Test calendar UI responsiveness

2. **API Integration Testing**
   - Verify API functions correctly filter data by date range
   - Test with various date range sizes (days, months, years)
   - Confirm filtered results match expected data
   - Test performance with large datasets

3. **Screen Integration Testing**
   - Test filter integration on all report screens
   - Verify charts and statistics update correctly with filters
   - Confirm loading states display during filter application
   - Test filter state persistence within reports section

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test behavior with invalid date ranges
   - Verify error messages for network issues during filtering
   - Test graceful handling of empty filtered results
   - Confirm reset functionality works correctly

### Success Criteria
- Date range picker component works smoothly across all screens
- All report APIs correctly filter data by date range
- Filtered charts and statistics display accurate data
- Loading states and error handling function properly
- User experience is intuitive and consistent

## Verification

### Completion Criteria
1. ✅ DateRangePicker component created and functional
2. ✅ Predefined quick filters implemented (Today, This Month, etc.)
3. ✅ All report API functions updated with date range parameters
4. ✅ Financial reports screens integrated with date filtering
5. ✅ Property performance screens support date filtering
6. ✅ Tenant occupancy reports include date range filtering
7. ✅ Maintenance cost analysis supports date filtering
8. ✅ Filter state management implemented
9. ✅ Loading states and error handling added
10. ✅ Responsive design works on all screen sizes

### Test Results
