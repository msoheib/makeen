# PBI-4: Reports with Data Visualization

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-4)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive reporting system with data visualization to provide property managers with actionable insights through charts, graphs, and detailed analytics using real data from the integrated database.

## Problem Statement

Property managers need visual reports and analytics to make informed business decisions. The current reports tab exists but lacks actual reporting functionality with charts, graphs, and data visualization that would help analyze property performance, financial trends, and operational metrics.

## User Stories

- As a property manager, I want to see financial summary reports so I can track revenue and expenses
- As a property manager, I want to view property performance analytics so I can identify top/bottom performing properties
- As a property manager, I want to see tenant occupancy reports so I can track vacancy rates
- As a property manager, I want to analyze maintenance costs so I can budget effectively
- As a property manager, I want to export reports so I can share insights with stakeholders
- As a property manager, I want to filter reports by date ranges so I can analyze specific periods

## Technical Approach

- Utilize existing API functions for data aggregation and filtering
- Implement charting library (React Native Chart Kit or Victory Native)
- Create data transformation utilities for chart formatting
- Build report generation with PDF export capabilities
- Add date range filtering and period comparison features
- Implement caching for performance optimization

## UX/UI Considerations

- Design clean, professional dashboard-style layouts
- Implement interactive charts with touch gestures
- Use consistent color schemes for data visualization
- Provide clear legends and data labels
- Include loading states for data-heavy operations
- Implement responsive design for different screen orientations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Financial summary reports display revenue, expenses, and profit charts
2. Property performance analytics show occupancy rates and revenue per property
3. Tenant reports include vacancy analysis and turnover metrics
4. Maintenance cost analysis shows spending trends and categories
5. Date range filtering allows custom period selection
6. Export functionality generates PDF reports
7. Charts are interactive with touch gestures and drill-down capabilities
8. Loading states display during data processing
9. Reports update in real-time when underlying data changes

## Dependencies

- Existing API functions for data aggregation
- Charting library installation (React Native Chart Kit or Victory Native)
- PDF generation library (react-native-pdf-lib or similar)
- Date picker component for range selection
- Supabase database with all related tables

## Open Questions

- Which charting library should we use for optimal performance?
- Should we implement report scheduling and automatic generation?
- Do we need comparative analytics (year-over-year, month-over-month)?
