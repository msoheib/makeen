# [4-1] Setup charting library and infrastructure

[Back to task list](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Install and configure a charting library for data visualization in the React Native app. This task establishes the foundation for displaying charts and graphs in all report screens.

## Requirements

1. **Research and select appropriate charting library**
   - Must support React Native
   - Should work with Expo
   - Must support line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and area charts
   - Should have good performance and documentation
   - Must support touch interactions

2. **Install and configure the charting library**
   - Add to package.json dependencies
   - Configure any required native dependencies
   - Set up basic theming to match app design

3. **Create reusable chart components**
   - LineChart component
   - BarChart component  
   - PieChart component
   - AreaChart component
   - Common chart styling and theming

4. **Test basic chart functionality**
   - Render sample data in each chart type
   - Verify touch interactions work
   - Ensure charts respect app theme (light/dark mode)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research phase**
   - Evaluate react-native-chart-kit
   - Evaluate victory-native
   - Evaluate react-native-svg-charts
   - Select best option based on requirements

2. **Installation phase**
   - Install chosen library and dependencies
   - Configure metro.config.js if needed
   - Test basic installation

3. **Component creation phase**
   - Create /components/charts/ directory
   - Build wrapper components for each chart type
   - Implement theming integration
   - Add TypeScript types

4. **Testing phase**
   - Create sample data for testing
   - Verify all chart types render correctly
   - Test theme switching
   - Test touch interactions

## Verification

✅ **Installation Success Criteria:**
- Charting library installed without errors
- App builds and runs successfully
- No dependency conflicts

✅ **Component Success Criteria:**
- All 4 chart types (Line, Bar, Pie, Area) components created
- Charts render with sample data
- Charts respect app theme colors
- Touch interactions functional

✅ **Integration Success Criteria:**
- Chart components can be imported and used
- Charts integrate with existing app styling
- Performance is acceptable (no lag)

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added charting library dependency
- `components/charts/` - New directory with chart components
- `lib/theme.ts` - Updated with chart color schemes
- Any metro or configuration files if needed

## Test Plan

**Objective:** Verify charting library installation and basic functionality

**Test Scope:** Chart component rendering and basic interactions

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. Install library without errors
2. Create sample charts with test data
3. Verify charts render in light and dark themes
4. Test touch interactions (zoom, pan if supported)
5. Verify performance with moderate data sets

**Success Criteria:** All chart types render correctly and respond to touch interactions without performance issues
