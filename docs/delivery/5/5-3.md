# 5-3 Create notification center UI

[Back to task list](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Build a comprehensive notification center UI that displays in-app notification history, allows users to view, mark as read, and manage their notifications. This includes creating notification cards, filtering capabilities, and integration with the real-time notification system from previous tasks.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Notification Center Screen**: Create dedicated notification management screen
2. **Notification History**: Display chronological list of all notifications
3. **Notification Cards**: Individual notification components with proper styling
4. **Read/Unread States**: Visual distinction and management of read status
5. **Filtering System**: Filter notifications by type, date, read status
6. **Real-time Updates**: Live updates when new notifications arrive
7. **Action Handling**: Navigate to relevant screens when notifications are tapped
8. **Empty States**: Proper empty state handling when no notifications exist
9. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
10. **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh capability for notification list

### UI/UX Requirements
- Material Design 3 components and styling
- Proper accessibility labels and navigation
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive gesture support (swipe actions)
- Clear visual hierarchy and typography

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript integration with proper types
- React Native FlatList for performance with large lists
- AsyncStorage integration for persistence
- Real-time subscription for live updates
- Navigation integration with deep linking
- Performance optimization for large notification lists

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Layer
- Create notification storage system with AsyncStorage
- Implement notification CRUD operations
- Set up notification state management
- Create notification data types and interfaces

### Phase 2: UI Components
- Create NotificationCard component
- Build NotificationList component
- Implement notification type icons and styling
- Add read/unread visual indicators

### Phase 3: Notification Center Screen
- Build main notification center screen
- Implement filtering and search functionality
- Add pull-to-refresh and loading states
- Handle empty states and error conditions

### Phase 4: Real-time Integration
- Connect to real-time notification events
- Implement live notification updates
- Add notification sound and vibration
- Handle background/foreground state changes

### Phase 5: Navigation and Actions
- Implement notification tap handling
- Set up deep linking to relevant screens
- Add mark as read/unread functionality
- Implement bulk notification actions

## Test Plan

### Unit Testing
1. **Notification Storage**: Test CRUD operations and persistence
2. **Component Rendering**: Test notification card display and states
3. **Filtering Logic**: Test notification filtering and sorting
4. **State Management**: Test read/unread state changes
5. **Real-time Integration**: Test live notification updates

### Integration Testing
1. **Navigation Flow**: Test navigation from notifications to target screens
2. **Real-time Updates**: Test live notification arrival and display
3. **Performance**: Test with large numbers of notifications
4. **Platform Testing**: Test on iOS and Android platforms

### E2E Testing
1. **User Journey**: Complete notification flow from creation to action
2. **Background/Foreground**: Test notification handling in different app states
3. **Notification Actions**: Test mark as read, navigation, and bulk actions
4. **Empty States**: Test no notifications and loading scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Components
- `components/NotificationCard.tsx` - Individual notification display component
- `components/NotificationList.tsx` - Optimized list component for notifications
- `components/NotificationEmpty.tsx` - Empty state component

### New Screens
- `app/notifications/index.tsx` - Main notification center screen
- `app/notifications/[id].tsx` - Individual notification detail screen (optional)

### Utility Files
- `lib/notificationStorage.ts` - Notification persistence and CRUD operations
- `hooks/useNotificationCenter.ts` - Custom hook for notification center state

### Enhanced Files
- `hooks/useNotifications.ts` - Add notification center integration
- `lib/notifications.ts` - Add storage integration methods

## Business Rules

### Notification Display Rules
1. **Chronological Order**: Latest notifications appear first
2. **Read Status**: Clear visual distinction between read/unread
3. **Type Grouping**: Optional grouping by notification type
4. **Date Grouping**: Group notifications by date (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
5. **Retention Policy**: Keep notifications for 30 days maximum

### Notification Actions
1. **Mark as Read**: Single tap marks notification as read
2. **Navigate**: Tap action navigates to relevant screen
3. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple notifications for batch operations
4. **Swipe Actions**: Swipe gestures for quick actions
5. **Delete**: Option to delete individual or bulk notifications

### User Experience Rules
1. **Performance**: Smooth scrolling with 60fps target
2. **Accessibility**: Full screen reader support
3. **Offline Support**: Display cached notifications when offline
4. **Real-time Updates**: Live updates without user intervention
5. **Persistence**: Maintain scroll position and filter state
