# PBI-5: Real-time Notifications System

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-5)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive real-time notifications system that keeps users informed about critical events, updates, and activities within the real estate management app using Supabase real-time capabilities and push notifications.

## Problem Statement

Users need to stay informed about important events such as new maintenance requests, payment receipts, tenant applications, and system updates. Currently, there is no notification system to alert users about time-sensitive activities, which can lead to delayed responses and missed opportunities.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to receive push notifications so I can stay informed even when the app is closed
- As a property manager, I want to be notified of new maintenance requests so I can respond quickly
- As an accountant, I want to be notified of new payments so I can update records promptly
- As a user, I want to manage notification preferences so I can control what notifications I receive
- As a user, I want to see notification history so I can review past alerts
- As a user, I want to mark notifications as read so I can track what I've addressed

## Technical Approach

- Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions for database changes
- Integrate Expo push notifications for mobile alerts
- Create notification preferences management system
- Build in-app notification center with history
- Add notification badges and counters throughout the app
- Implement notification routing to relevant screens

## UX/UI Considerations

- Design subtle, non-intrusive notification indicators
- Implement notification categories with different visual styles
- Provide clear notification settings with granular controls
- Include notification previews and quick actions
- Use appropriate sound and vibration patterns
- Implement notification grouping and threading

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Push notifications work when app is in background or closed
2. Real-time updates display immediately when app is active
3. Notification center shows history of all notifications
4. Notification preferences allow granular control
5. Badges display unread notification counts
6. Tapping notifications navigates to relevant screens
7. Notifications include relevant context and actions
8. System handles notification permissions properly
9. Notifications work across different user roles and permissions

## Dependencies

- Supabase real-time subscription setup
- Expo push notification service configuration
- Device permission handling for notifications
- Background app refresh capabilities
- User authentication and role management

## Open Questions

- Should we implement email notifications in addition to push notifications?
- Do we need notification scheduling for reminders?
- Should we include notification analytics and delivery tracking?
