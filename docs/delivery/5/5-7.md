## Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Notification Categories**
   - Implement comprehensive category system (maintenance, payment, tenant, property, system, invoice, contract)
   - Category-specific notification icons and color coding
   - Category-based notification grouping and organization
   - Category statistics and counters

2. **Advanced Filtering System**
   - Multi-criteria filtering (category, priority, date range, read status)
   - Real-time filter application with instant results
   - Persistent filter preferences and saved filter presets
   - Filter combination and complex query support

3. **Search and Sort Capabilities**
   - Full-text search across notification content
   - Smart search suggestions and autocomplete
   - Multiple sorting options (date, priority, category, read status)
   - Search history and saved searches

4. **Priority Management**
   - Priority-based notification organization
   - Priority indicators and visual hierarchy
   - Priority-specific filtering and sorting
   - Urgent notification highlighting

### Technical Requirements
