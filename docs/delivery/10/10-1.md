# 10-1 Update drawer configuration to remove overlay

## Description
Adjust the main drawer navigator configuration so that no dimming/fading overlay is applied when the sidebar opens. This involves setting `overlayColor` to `transparent` (or removing the property) in `app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx` and validating that no other code re-introduces opacity.

## Requirements
- Update drawer config as described.
- Verify on Android and iOS simulators.
- Ensure tap-outside still closes drawer.
- Ensure no residual opacity.

## Implementation Plan
1. Edit `app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx` and set `overlayColor="transparent"`.
2. Clean up any remaining custom overlay logic or opacity.
3. Run the app on both platforms, manually test open/close.
4. Update snapshot or screenshots if necessary.

## Test Plan
- Launch app: drawer closed, full visibility.
- Tap hamburger: drawer opens, **no dimming**.
- Tap outside or swipe: drawer closes, no opacity changes on main screen.
- Repeat quickly to ensure no flicker.

## Verification
Manual QA on Android (Pixel 5) and iOS (iPhone 14) simulators.

## Files Modified
- `app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx`
