# PBI-3: Finance Voucher and Invoice System

[View in Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-3)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive financial management screens for creating and managing vouchers (receipt, payment, entry) and invoices, fully integrated with the existing chart of accounts and financial API.

## Problem Statement

Accountants and property managers need functional screens to create and manage financial transactions. The sidebar contains finance options but lacks the actual forms and screens to handle voucher creation, invoice management, and financial record keeping.

## User Stories

- As an accountant, I want to create receipt vouchers so I can record incoming payments
- As an accountant, I want to create payment vouchers so I can record outgoing expenses
- As an accountant, I want to create entry vouchers so I can record journal entries
- As an accountant, I want to manage VAT invoices so I can handle billing properly
- As an accountant, I want to select from chart of accounts so I can ensure proper categorization
- As an accountant, I want to validate financial entries so I can maintain accurate records

## Technical Approach

- Utilize existing `vouchersApi.create()` functions for different voucher types
- Implement `invoicesApi.create()` and `invoicesApi.getAll()` functionality
- Connect to `accountsApi.getChartOfAccounts()` for account selection
- Create forms with financial validation and error handling
- Implement multi-step forms for complex voucher creation
- Add financial calculations and VAT handling

## UX/UI Considerations

- Follow accounting workflow patterns and professional design
- Implement clear form validation with immediate feedback
- Provide account selection with search and categorization
- Include calculator functionality for amount calculations
- Use consistent number formatting for currency display
- Implement confirmation dialogs for financial transactions

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Receipt voucher form creates voucher records in database
2. Payment voucher form handles expense transactions
3. Entry voucher form enables journal entry creation
4. VAT invoice management allows billing operations
5. Chart of accounts integration provides proper categorization
6. Financial validation prevents invalid entries
7. Amount calculations work correctly with decimal precision
8. Error handling provides clear financial error messages
9. Form data persists during navigation interruptions
10. âœ… Payments viewing screen displays all voucher data with filtering and search
