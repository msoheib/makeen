## Notes

This task focuses on journal entry voucher creation, which is the most flexible form of accounting entry. Unlike receipt and payment vouchers which have predefined debit/credit patterns, journal entries allow complete flexibility for:

- Adjusting entries
- Accrual entries  
- Depreciation entries
- Correction entries
- Complex multi-account transactions
- Period-end adjustments

The form must maintain strict double-entry accounting principles while providing maximum flexibility for professional accounting workflows. The system should guide users towards balanced entries while preventing submission of unbalanced transactions.
