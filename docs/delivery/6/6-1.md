- Add proper loading states and error handling
- Integrate with Supabase profiles table for data persistence
- Implement photo upload placeholder with future enhancement indication
- Add form validation with real-time feedback
- Include success/error messaging for save operations

### Technical Requirements
- Extend current app/profile/index.tsx implementation
- Use existing profile API from lib/api.ts
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Maintain consistency with other app screens
- Add proper TypeScript typing for all form data

### UI/UX Requirements

- Add loading indicators during save operations
- Provide clear validation feedback
- Include cancel/save confirmation for unsaved changes
- Show user role and member since information

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment and Enhancement Planning
1. Review existing profile screen implementation
2. Identify gaps in current functionality
3. Plan enhancement approach following app patterns

### Phase 2: Form Enhancement
1. Improve form validation with real-time feedback
2. Add loading states for save operations
3. Enhance error messaging and user feedback
4. Add unsaved changes detection

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Test profile updates with Supabase backend
2. Verify error scenarios handle gracefully
3. Ensure consistency with app design patterns
4. Test on various profile data scenarios

### Phase 4: Photo Upload Preparation
1. Add photo upload UI with "coming soon" state
2. Prepare infrastructure for future implementation
3. Add placeholder avatar functionality

## Verification

### Test Plan

**Test Scope**: Enhanced profile management functionality

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Form Validation Testing**:
   - Empty required fields show appropriate errors
   - Email format validation works correctly
   - Phone number format validation functions
   - Real-time validation feedback appears

2. **Save Operation Testing**:
   - Profile updates save successfully to Supabase
   - Loading states appear during save operations
   - Success messages show after successful saves
   - Error messages display for failed saves

3. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Form fields populate with current user data
   - Cancel functionality works without saving changes
   - Navigation back preserves unsaved data or warns user
   - Avatar displays correctly (current or placeholder)

4. **Error Scenario Testing**:
   - Network errors handle gracefully
   - Database constraint violations show user-friendly messages
   - Duplicate email addresses handled appropriately

**Success Criteria**:
- All form validation works as expected
- Profile data saves successfully to database
- Loading and error states provide clear user feedback
- UI maintains consistency with app design patterns
