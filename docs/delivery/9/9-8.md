## Requirements
1. Replace hard-coded English strings in `reports` list with translation keys.
2. Ensure Lucide icons are mirrored when RTL (via `rtlLayout.iconTransform.mirror`).
3. Update charts (Bar / Line etc.) to use RTL-aware orientation (flip X-axis if needed).
4. Verify dashboards show Arabic titles when language is Arabic.

## Implementation Plan
- Add description keys to `reports.json` (EN & AR).
- Refactor `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/reports.tsx` to use `useTranslation('reports')`.
- Wrap directional icons with `rtlLayout.iconTransform.mirror` where appropriate.
- Test charts in Revenue / Expense / Property Performance pages to confirm axis direction.

## Verification
- Manual: switch to Arabic â†’ Reports screen fully in Arabic, layout mirrors.
- Unit: Jest snapshot of generated `reports` list for both languages.

## Files Modified
- `lib/translations/en/reports.json`
- `lib/translations/ar/reports.json`
- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/reports.tsx`
- `components/charts/*` (as needed)
