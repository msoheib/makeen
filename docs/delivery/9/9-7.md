# 9-7 Testing and Validation

[Back to task list](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Thoroughly test the i18n and RTL implementation across the entire application. This includes verifying all translations, ensuring correct RTL layout rendering, testing language switching, and validating that all UI components and navigation elements function correctly in both English and Arabic.

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Language Switching and Persistence
- **Objective**: Verify that language switching works correctly and persists across app restarts.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the Language screen.
  2. Switch from English to Arabic.
  3. Verify that the UI updates immediately to Arabic and RTL layout.
  4. Restart the application.
  5. Verify that the app launches in Arabic.
  6. Switch back to English and repeat the process.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - UI updates instantly upon language change.
  - Language selection is persisted correctly.
  - RTL layout is applied/removed correctly.

### Phase 2: Translation and Content Verification
- **Objective**: Ensure all text content is correctly translated in both languages.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Navigate through all screens of the application in English.
  2. Verify that all text is displayed correctly.
  3. Switch to Arabic.
  4. Navigate through all screens again.
  5. Verify that all text is translated to Arabic.
  6. Check for any missing translations or text overflows.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All UI text is translated.
  - No hardcoded English strings remain.
  - Arabic text is grammatically correct and culturally appropriate.

### Phase 3: RTL Layout and UI Component Validation
- **Objective**: Validate that all UI components and layouts render correctly in RTL mode.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. In Arabic mode, inspect all screens for layout issues.
  2. Verify that flexbox layouts, text alignment, and icon positioning are correct.
  3. Test all interactive elements (buttons, forms, lists) to ensure they function correctly in RTL.
  4. Check for any visual bugs, such as overlapping elements or incorrect spacing.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All components are mirrored correctly for RTL.
  - Text and icons are positioned correctly.
  - No visual or functional regressions are present in RTL mode.

### Phase 4: Final Validation
- **Objective**: Perform a final smoke test of the application in both languages.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Perform a full user flow in both English and Arabic.
  2. Document any bugs or issues found.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - The application is fully functional and visually correct in both languages.
  - PBI-9 is ready to be marked as complete.
