# PBI-9: RTL Support and Arabic Translation

[Back to Backlog](mdc:../backlog.md#user-content-9)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Right-to-Left (RTL) layout support and full Arabic translation for the Real Estate Management application to serve Arabic-speaking users in the Saudi Arabian market. This includes internationalization infrastructure, cultural adaptations, and seamless language switching capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the Real Estate Management app only supports English and left-to-right (LTR) layout, limiting its accessibility to Arabic-speaking users who expect native RTL text flow and Arabic language support. Given that the app targets the Saudi Arabian real estate market, Arabic language support is essential for wider adoption and user experience.

Key challenges to address:
- **Language Barrier**: English-only interface excludes Arabic-speaking users
- **Text Direction**: LTR layout doesn't align with Arabic reading patterns
- **Cultural Context**: UI/UX needs adaptation for Arabic-speaking markets
- **Navigation Flow**: RTL affects menu placement, navigation patterns, and visual hierarchy
- **Content Layout**: Charts, forms, and data tables need RTL consideration

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **Language Selection**: As an Arabic-speaking user, I want to switch the app language to Arabic so that I can use the app in my native language
2. **RTL Layout**: As an Arabic user, I want the app layout to flow from right-to-left so that the interface feels natural and familiar
3. **Arabic Text**: As an Arabic user, I want all app content (labels, buttons, messages) displayed in Arabic so that I can understand all functionality
4. **Cultural Adaptation**: As an Arabic user, I want date formats, number formats, and other locale-specific elements to match Arabic conventions

### Secondary User Stories
5. **Seamless Switching**: As a bilingual user, I want to easily switch between English and Arabic without losing my current context
6. **Consistent Experience**: As an Arabic user, I want all screens and components to properly support RTL layout without visual glitches

## Technical Approach

### 1. Internationalization Infrastructure
- **Library Selection**: Implement `react-i18next` for robust i18n support
- **Namespace Organization**: Structure translations by feature areas (dashboard, properties, tenants, etc.)
- **Dynamic Loading**: Support for dynamic language switching without app restart
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration for translation keys

### 2. RTL Layout Implementation
- **React Native I18nManager**: Leverage built-in RTL support
- **StyleSheet Adjustments**: Modify styles to use `start`/`end` instead of `left`/`right`
- **Icon Mirroring**: Implement directional icon switching for navigation elements
- **Component Adaptation**: Update all custom components for RTL support

### 3. Translation Management
- **Translation Files**: Create comprehensive Arabic translation files
- **Key Structure**: Hierarchical organization matching app structure
- **Pluralization**: Handle Arabic plural forms correctly
- **Context-Aware**: Support for different translations based on context

### 4. Cultural Adaptations
- **Date Formats**: Arabic date formatting and calendar considerations
- **Number Formatting**: Arabic-Indic numerals support
- **Currency Display**: Proper SAR currency formatting in Arabic
- **Text Length**: Account for Arabic text expansion/contraction

## UX/UI Considerations

### RTL Layout Changes
- **Navigation**: Hamburger menu slides from right, back buttons flip
- **Tab Bar**: Icon and text alignment adjustments
- **Cards and Lists**: Content alignment and padding adjustments
- **Forms**: Label and input field positioning
- **Charts**: Legend and axis label positioning

### Arabic Typography
- **Font Selection**: Choose appropriate Arabic fonts for readability
- **Line Height**: Adjust for Arabic character heights and diacritics
- **Text Alignment**: Proper right-alignment for Arabic text
- **Mixed Content**: Handle Arabic-English mixed content gracefully

### Cultural Design Elements
- **Color Schemes**: Consider cultural color preferences
- **Icons**: Ensure icons are culturally appropriate
- **Layout Patterns**: Follow Arabic UI conventions where applicable

## Open Questions

1. **Translation Quality**: Should we use professional translation services or start with machine translation?
2. **Arabic Variants**: Should we support different Arabic dialects or stick to Modern Standard Arabic?
3. **Font Strategy**: Should we include custom Arabic fonts or rely on system fonts?
4. **Performance**: What's the acceptable performance impact for RTL layout switching?
5. **Testing Strategy**: How extensive should our Arabic user testing be?
6. **Maintenance**: How will we keep Arabic translations updated with new features?
