# 9-6 Implement Language Switching

[Back to task list](mdc:tasks.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive language selection mechanism that allows users to switch between English and Arabic languages with proper persistence. This includes enhancing the existing language screen, integrating the language switcher with the i18n system, and ensuring proper RTL layout switching when Arabic is selected.

## Requirements

### Primary Features
1. **Enhanced Language Selection Screen**
   - Update existing `/language` screen with proper i18n integration
   - Add language selection with visual indicators for current language
   - Include language preview/description for each option
   - Implement immediate language switching with confirmation

2. **Language Persistence**
   - Store selected language in AsyncStorage
   - Maintain language preference across app restarts
   - Synchronize with i18n system initialization

3. **RTL Layout Integration**
   - Automatically switch to RTL layout when Arabic is selected
   - Switch back to LTR when English is selected
   - Apply layout changes throughout the app immediately

4. **Settings Integration**
   - Update settings screen to show current language
   - Provide easy access to language selection
   - Display language information in user-friendly format

### Technical Implementation
1. **Language Store Enhancement**
   - Extend existing store with language selection methods
   - Add language change handlers with RTL switching
   - Implement language validation and fallback logic

2. **i18n Integration**
   - Integrate language switcher with react-i18next
   - Ensure proper resource loading for selected language
   - Handle language change events throughout the app

3. **UI Components**
   - Create language selection components with proper styling
   - Add language indicators and preview functionality
   - Implement smooth transitions between languages

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Language Store Enhancement
- [ ] Extend store with language management functions
- [ ] Add language persistence with AsyncStorage
- [ ] Implement language validation and defaults

### Phase 2: Language Selection Screen
- [ ] Update existing `/language` screen with i18n
- [ ] Add language selection options with visual indicators
- [ ] Implement language switching with confirmation

### Phase 3: RTL Integration
- [ ] Connect language switching to RTL layout changes
- [ ] Test automatic layout switching
- [ ] Ensure proper app-wide language updates

### Phase 4: Settings Integration
- [ ] Update settings screen with current language display
- [ ] Add navigation to language selection
- [ ] Test complete language switching workflow

## Test Plan

### Language Selection Testing
- [ ] Verify language options are displayed correctly
- [ ] Test language switching functionality
- [ ] Confirm language persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Validate proper UI updates after language change

### RTL Layout Testing
- [ ] Test automatic RTL switching when Arabic is selected
- [ ] Verify LTR layout when English is selected
- [ ] Check all components adapt correctly to layout changes
- [ ] Test navigation and interaction in both directions

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test language switching from settings screen
- [ ] Verify language indicator updates throughout app
- [ ] Test app behavior with invalid language preferences
- [ ] Confirm proper fallback to default language

## Verification

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can select between English and Arabic languages
- [ ] Language selection persists across app sessions
- [ ] RTL layout automatically activates with Arabic selection
- [ ] All UI text updates immediately upon language change
- [ ] Settings screen displays current language accurately

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Language store properly manages language state
- [ ] AsyncStorage correctly persists language preferences
- [ ] i18n system responds correctly to language changes
- [ ] RTL utilities function properly with language switching
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues during language switching

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Language switching is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly indicates current language
- [ ] Language change confirmation prevents accidental switches
- [ ] App remains usable during language transition
- [ ] No UI glitches or layout issues during switching
