### Summary of RTL Fixes Applied:
- **SideBar Component**: Fixed text alignment, flex directions, and margin usage with proper RTL utilities
- **ModernHeader Component**: Replaced hardcoded `row-reverse` with RTL-aware `getFlexDirection()`, fixed arrow directions for RTL
- **Dashboard Screen**: Fixed all hardcoded `flexDirection: 'row'` to use RTL-aware `getFlexDirection('row')`
- **Tenants Screen**: Fixed hardcoded flex directions and updated component usages with RTL utilities
- **Reports Screen**: Already had proper RTL integration from previous fixes

### Technical Improvements:
- Replaced hardcoded `flexDirection: 'row'` with `getFlexDirection('row')` throughout the app
- Updated text alignment from `rtlStyles.textLeft` to `rtlStyles.textAlignStart` 
- Fixed margin and padding usage with RTL-aware utilities
- Ensured consistent RTL behavior across web and mobile platforms
- Removed deprecated `writingDirection: 'rtl'` usage
- Proper arrow direction handling for back buttons in RTL mode

The app now has consistent RTL layout behavior between web emulation and mobile app versions.
