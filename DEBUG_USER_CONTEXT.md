# üîç USER CONTEXT DEBUG TEST\n\n## Purpose\nThis document is for debugging the current user context and security implementation.\n\n## Test Instructions\n\n1. **Open the app and go to any screen**\n2. **Check the console logs** for:\n   - `[Security] User context loaded:` - Shows current user role and property access\n   - `[PropertiesAPI] User context for getAll():` - Shows security filtering for properties\n   - `[Dashboard] API result:` - Shows dashboard data filtering\n\n## Expected Console Output\n\n### For Tenant User:\n```\n[Security] User context loaded: {\n  userId: \"user-id\",\n  role: \"tenant\",\n  profileType: \"tenant\",\n  propertiesOwned: 0,\n  propertiesRented: 1\n}\n[PropertiesAPI] Applied tenant filter: available OR rented properties\n```\n\n### For Owner User:\n```\n[Security] User context loaded: {\n  userId: \"user-id\",\n  role: \"owner\",\n  profileType: \"owner\",\n  propertiesOwned: 3,\n  propertiesRented: 0\n}\n[PropertiesAPI] Applied owner filter: only owned properties\n```\n\n### For Admin User:\n```\n[Security] User context loaded: {\n  userId: \"user-id\",\n  role: \"admin\",\n  profileType: \"admin\",\n  propertiesOwned: 0,\n  propertiesRented: 0\n}\n[PropertiesAPI] No filtering applied (admin user)\n```\n\n## Current Issue Analysis\n\nThe user reported seeing \"everything except properties filtered as available for rent\" which suggests:\n\n1. **Properties API** is working correctly (showing only available properties)\n2. **Other screens** might still be using static data\n3. **User context** might be loading correctly\n4. **Role detection** needs verification\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Check console logs for user context information\n2. Verify which role the current user has\n3. Test with different user roles\n4. Identify any screens still using static data
